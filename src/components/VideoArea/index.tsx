            In my third Integrative Project, I developed a page for the
            my mother&apos;s entrepreneurship, where the activities are detailed
            offered, the team behind and the services available. Implemented
            a booking system that allows registered users
            Schedule and cancel appointments according to your needs.

            In my last Integrative Project, I designed a specialized e-commerce
            on Apple products. Registered users can browse and
            search for products in detail, add items to the
            purchases, place orders, and cancel orders if desired.

            In my final project, together with my team, we created a platform of
            streaming for E-sports tournaments. Users can view
            tournaments, form teams and join competitions. I contributed to
            the development of multiple elements, such as buttons, banners,
            business cards, filters, forms, charts,
            interfaces, modals, administrative sections, and tables.
